The final corpus is `lyrics-dataset-updated-v2.xlsx` (the reject modernity, embrace tradition version of version control)

The code for creating the corpus (web scraping and lyrics and feature collection) can be found in the `dataset collection` folder in the `collect_dataset.ipynb` and `explore_dataset.ipynb` files.

The code for sentiment analysis and graphs can be found in `experiments_pt_3.ipynb` which also links to Colab.

I apologize for the lack of clear comments/markdown. Mayhaps I will fix this at a future date.

For your viewing enjoyment, I have also added `experiments.ipynb` and `experiments_pt2.ipynb` to this repo. These files contain no code which I ended up using in the project, but are simply me figuring out what I can do with the lyrics and how I want to do it. If you are a brat fan, I especially recommend checking out `experiments.ipynb`. 
 
If you're wondering what the brat folder is, I tested out my code on the brat album because it was a much smaller sample size than the Grammy Awards corpus I was planning on collecting

If you're wondering what joining dataset.ipynb is, by the time nominations for 2025 were announced, I had already collected my dataset and I didn't want to run the code from 1960 again because my laptop almost died the first time. I used the brat code I had to generate the same dataset only for 2025 and simply added it to my existing data. Thank you, Charli xcx!
