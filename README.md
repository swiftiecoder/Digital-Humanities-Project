If you're wondering what the brat folder is, I tested out my code on the brat album because it was a much smaller sample size than the Grammy Awards corpus I was planning on collecting

If you're wondering what joining dataset.ipynb is, you're very curious! By the time nominations for 2025 were announced, I had already collected my dataset and I didn't want to run the code from 1960 again because my laptop almost died the first time. I used the brat code I had to generate the same dataset only for 2025 and simply added it to my existing data. Thank you, Charli xcx!
