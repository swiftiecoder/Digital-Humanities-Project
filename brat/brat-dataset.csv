With the razor-sharp tongue stuck to skinny cigarettes
Calls him Daddy while she's fingering a gold cross
And she's kinda fucked up, but she's still in Vogue
Yeah, she's in her mid-twenties, real intelligent
And you hate the fact she's New York City's darling
You said she's problematic and the way you say it, so fanatic
Think she already knows that you're obsessed

I Think About It All the Time,Charli xcx,"I think about it all the time
That I might run out of time

I was walking around in Stockholm
Seriously thinking 'bout my future for the first time
It was ice-cold, playing demos on my iPhone
I went to my friend's place and I met their baby for the first time
How sublime
What a joy, oh my, oh my
Standing there
Same old clothes she wore before, holding her child, yeah
She's a radiant mother, and he's a bеautiful father
And now they both know thesе things that I don't

While you're sittin' in your dad's basement
Bet you're disappointed that I'm shinin'
I'm just living that life
Von Dutch, cult classic, but I still pop
Pop the LV cases, watch me do a little globe trot
Got a lot to say about my debut
About my constant revenue
I guess it makes sense 'cause I'm just living that life

You just wanna scream my name
On and on, on and on
'Cause I'm just living that
You just wanna scream my name
On and on, on and on

Linked with Addison on Melrose
Bought some cute clothes and wrote this in the studio
'Cause I'm just living that life
Von Dutch, cult classic, but I still pop
Always give me more views, it's kinda like your day job
Got a lot to say about my debut
About all of the things I do

So I feat a.g. cook,Charli xcx,"
Now I wanna think about all the good times
First met on the outskirts of Stockholm
All of your things in a black suitcase
First day, made Vroom Vroom and the place went-
Now I wanna think about all the good times
Head bop, bop with your arm brought dancing
Hot pink jacket on, music turned on
Bounce that track, make us late to the party
Now I wanna think about all the good times
First time I ever felt alive on stage
In Texas in matching latex, that's as cool as I'm ever gonna feel

Beautiful

Now I wanna think about all the good times
Me and A.G. on MØ hall and crazy Uber
Straight from a video shoot
Got birthday cake on the way
Now I wanna think about all the good times
Best night ever in Arco, Centi
So many friends right there in that audience
When I look back, what the fuck was I wearing?
Now I wanna think about all the good times
One big smile cracked the whole world open
Sipping green juice, looking so chic
Softer spots while you play with attention
Now I wanna think about all the good times
When you brought me to a BB down to bubbles
Took our shoes off, ran around barefoot
Played that song we made that day
Now I wanna think about all the good times
DJ sat back to back with Twiggy
She was nervous, you were so nice
Said you had the best time with her
Now I wanna think about all the good times
Me and Naomi cried to your songs
No songs ever made us feel that much
Can't explain 'cause it's just too much
Now I wanna think about all the good times
Talking on Zoom in 2020
Red hair brushed out, sat back home
Lyrics back and forth from texts
Now I wanna think about all the good times
Like the first time I heard your music
My ex-boyfriend played your SoundCloud
That moment really changed my life

Yeah, I don't know if you like me
Sometimes I think you might hate me
Sometimes I think I might hate you
Maybe you just wanna be me
You always say, ""Let's go out""
So we go eat at a restaurant
Sometimes it feels a bit awkward
'Cause we don't have much in common

People say we're alike
They say we've got the same hair
We talk about making music
But I don't know if it's honest
Can't tell if you wanna see me
Falling over and failing
And you can't tell what you're feeling
I think I know how you feel

Well, honestly, I was speechless
When I woke up to your voice note
You told me how you'd been feeling
Let's work it out on the remix
You'd always say, ""Let's go out""
But then I'd cancel last minute
I was so lost in my head
And scared to be in your pictures
'Cause for the last couple years
I've been at war with my body
I tried to starve myself thinner
And then I gained all the weight back
I was trapped in the hatred
And your life seemed so awesome
I never thought for a second
My voice was in your head
""Girl, you walk like a bitch""
When I was ten, someone said that
And it's just self-defence
Until you're building a weapon
She believed my projection
And now I totally get it
Forgot that inside the icon
There's still a young girl from Essex
People say we're alike
They say we've got the same hair
It's you and me on the coin
The industry loves to spend
And when we put this to bed
The internet will go crazy
I'm glad I know how you feel
'Cause I ride for you, Charli (Charli, Charli)

Too hot, when I sweat, just lick me
Touch and squeeze when the bassline hits me
Are you gonna ride me?
Harder than a BPM, beat match me (Yeah, I'm lovin' that)
Can't see straight, yeah, I love it when the pill hits
Back of the booth, bitch, guest list, VIP
Party don't start 'til a bitch come find me
Party girl, party girl (Yeah, I'm lovin' that)

Push my hair back, look hot when I'm (Bumpin' that)
No, I really don't stop when I'm (Bumpin' that)
Gonna jump when it drops when I'm (I'm bumpin' that)
Dial 999, it's a good time
Who the fuck are you? I'm a brat when I'm bumpin' that
Now I wanna hear my track, are you bumpin' that?
'Til the windows crack, I'll be (Bumpin' that)
No, I never go home, don't sleep, don't (Ah)

Guess feat billie eilish,Charli xcx,"Hey, Billie, you there?
Uh-uh

You wanna guess the colour of my underwear
You wanna know what I got goin' on down there
Is it pretty in pink or all see-through?
Is it showin' off my brand-new lower-back tattoo?
You wanna put 'em in your mouth, pull 'em all down south
You wanna turn this shit out, that's what I'm talkin' about
Pu-pu-pu-put 'em in your mouth, pull 'em all down south
You wanna turn this shit out, that's what l'm talkin' about (Yeah)

Try it, bite it, lick it, spit it
Pull it to the side and get all up in it
Wear 'em, post 'em, might remix it
Send 'em to The Dare, yeah, I think he's with it
Try it, bite it, lick it, spit it
Pull it to the side and get all up in it
Wear 'em, post 'em, might remix it
Eat it up for lunch, yeah, it's so delicious
(Work it out)

Don't have to guess the color of your underwear
Already know what you've got goin' on down there
It's that lacy black pair with the little bows
The ones I picked out for you in Tokyo
I saw them when you sat down, they were peekin' out
I'm gonna tell you right now, they're all I'm thinkin' about

I wanna try it, bite it, lick it, spit it
Pull it to the side and get all up in it
Kiss it, ride it, can I fit it?
Charli likes boys, but she knows I'd hit it
(Knows I'd hit it)
Charli, call me if you're with it

Yeah, guess, guess, guess, guess, guess, guess, guess, guess
Guess, guess, guess, guess, guess, guess, guess, guess
Guess, guess, guess, guess, guess, guess, guess, guess
Guess, guess, guess, guess, guess, guess, guess, guess

You wanna guess what me and Billie have been textin' about? (We've been disrespectful)
Still tryin' to guess the password to my Google Drive (Are you obsessed with me?)
You wanna guess the address of the party we're at (You know you're not invited)
You wanna guess if we're serious about this song",0.776,0.667,7.0,-6.622,1.0,0.0983,0.0146,0.3,0.0761,0.618,130.019,145219.0,4.0
