— Say, hello, everybody. Hello, nice to meet you. This a microphone, it tells a voice
— What does mommy use the microphone for?
— It's for, for mommy sing
— Yeah, for mommy's singing. Who's your favorite singer?
(Please, God, or whoever you are)
— Mommy

Please, God, or whoever you are
Please, God, or whoever you are
Please, God, or whoever you are
Please, God, or whoever you are

These days I get less calls 'cause no one wants to hear my voice
I miss the days when I was gettin' texts that I could just avoid
And I've been tryin' to be calm and not pre-emptively destroy
I wonder who here really loves me, or who wants to be employed
Every time I'm in the real world, I just end up paranoid
And stay at home all by my lonesome with my little baby boy
And I watch him on the kitchen floor, he's playin' with his toys
And I don't ever wanna leave him, but I don't think it's my choice
So I'm basking in these moments where I feel a shred of joy
But I don't think my pleas are heard because I'm screaming in the void
I'm screaming

Please, God, oh, you've gotta be sick
Why do you make it hurt, and why's it over so quick?
Please, God, I'm finally loved
I finally found somebody I don't wanna get rid of
Please, God, is it busy up there? (Please, God, or whoever you are)
You took a little while to respond to my prayer
Please, God, no, this doesn't seem fair
I'm tryin' not to show it, but I'm terribly scared

Please, God, or whoever you are
Please, God, or whoever you are
Please, God, or whoever you are
Please, God, or whoever you are
