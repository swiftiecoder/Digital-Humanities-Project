I left home and moved to Brooklyn where my boyfriend had a place
And he had track marks on his arms but had the most angelic face
I watched my friends die before twenty-one, and now I'm twenty-eight
I'm at the doctor's every day, because I can't stop losing weight
And now I'm the one with needles in my arms and in my legs
I'm making jokes about the blood tests, and I'm plannin' my estate
And I don't wanna blame the child, but I have to speculate
If this could all just be an answer to thosе prayers that came delayеd
Because I never would have said it if I knew I'd have to wait
Until the moment I was happy, then it all disintegrates, and I'm singin'

"Please, God, I don't wanna be sick
And I don't wanna hurt, so get it over with quick
Please, God, I wanna be loved
Don't wanna be somebody that you're tryna get rid of
Please, God, I don't wanna be sick
And I don't wanna hurt, so get it over with quick
Please, God, I wanna be loved
I don't wanna be somebody you're tryna get rid of"
