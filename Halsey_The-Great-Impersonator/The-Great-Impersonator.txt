No one has to know
I could always hide
But sometimes it might get to me
The things on all their minds
Like, "They don't know I'm lonely"
And, "They don't know I'm kind"
Or scared that I can't hack it with the current paradigm

Every single line
Every single rhyme
Every single truth I sing
Once started as a lie
I promise that I'm fine
But then I redesign
And put myself together like some little Frankenstein

Ah-ah
Does a story die with its narrator?
Ah-ah
Surely it's forgotten soon or later
Ah-ah
Hope they spell my name right in the paper
Ah-ah
In here lies the great impersonator
You might also like
Mm-mm

I'm lying in a car crash
In a pile of broken glass
It's funny how it looks like glitter from the overpass
I'm in a pick-up truck, the door is stuck, I'm sinking in the water
And the girl inside is waving, but the people just applaud her

This is a cry for help, callin' for assistance
But you can't tell I need it when you’re watchin' from a distance

Ah-ah
Does a story die with its narrator?
Ah-ah
Surely it's forgotten soon or later
Ah-ah
Hope they spell my name right in the paper
Ah-ah
In here lies the great impersonatorEmbed
