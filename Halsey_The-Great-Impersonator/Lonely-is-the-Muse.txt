I spent years becoming cool
And in one single second, you
Can make a decade of my efforts disappear
I'm just waiting at the bar
And you rip open all my scars
By saying something like, "Didn't know you were here"

I always knew I was a martyr
And that Jesus was one too
But I was built from special pieces
That I learned how to unscrew
And I can always reassemble
To fit perfectly for you
Or anybody that decides
That I'm of use

Lonely is the muse
Ah-ah
Lonely is the muse

So whеre do I go in the process
Whеn I'm just an apparatus?
I've inspired platinum records
I've earned platinum airline status
And I mined a couple diamonds
From the stories in my head
But I'm reduced to just a body
Here in someone else's bed
You might also like
Always knew I was a martyr
That Jesus was one too
But I was built from special pieces
That I learned how to unscrew
And I can always reassemble
To fit perfectly for you
Or anybody that decides
That I'm of use

Lonely is the muse
Ah-ah
Lonely is the muse
Ah-ah

And I will always be a martyr
I will fill your life with sounds
I'll be a wind chime in the window
Catching light to throw around
And I will tear apart your bedroom
I'll call you in the night
I will exist in every second
Just to decorate your life
And when you're done, you can discard me
Like the others always do
And I will nurse my wounds until
Another artist needs me new
And I will always reassemble to fit perfectly in view
For anybody that decides that I'm of use
Lonely is the muse
Ah-ah
Lonely is the muse
Ah-ah
Lonely is the muse
Lonely and forgotten is the8Embed
