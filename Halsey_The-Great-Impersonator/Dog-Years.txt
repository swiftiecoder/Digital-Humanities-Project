They said I have a universal blood type
I can give to anyone in need
But only receive from someone exactly like me (Mm)
And I'm trying to be positive
But oh, it's really hard
I'm a loner, I'm a loser
Won't you shoot me in the yard?
Put me down like a lame horse
Or send me to the farm
Where all the dogs go (Oh)

I've been a really good dog, can I come inside?
Yeah, I've been such a good girl, can we go for a ride?
I'm on a real short leash, but I like it tight
You know, I'm such a sweet girl, but I can rеally bite (I can really bite)

'Causе my dog died last year
He fell asleep in my embrace
And the very last thing I told him
Was, "See you soon and we can race"
You know a mercy kill is what I seek
I didn't ask to live, but dying's up to me

I've been a really good dog, can I come inside?
Yeah, I've been such a good girl, can we go for a ride?
I'm on a real short leash, but I like it tight
You know I'm such a sweet girl, but I can really bite

Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh
Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh

Well, they say all dogs go to Heaven
Well, what about a bitch?
What about an evil girl
Left lying in a ditch?
Tell the three people who asked that I am in a better place
With lots of trees and lots of grass
And lots of, lots of chocolate cake

'Cause I'm not old, but I am tired
I'm not strong, I'm very weak
I'm not old, but I am tired
I'm not here, I'm somewhere else
I'm not old, but I am tired
I'm one hundred ninety-six in dog years
I have seen enough
I've seen it all
I've been a really good dog, can I come inside?
Yeah, I've been such a good girl, can I go for a ride?
I'm on a real short leash, but I like it tight
You know I'm such a sweet girl, but I can really bite

Down like a lame horse
Or send me to the farm
Where all the dogs go3Embed
