My dad is almost home, I can't tell time yet, but I know
Because the air becomes electric and my mother cleans the stove
He'll walk in through the door and both my eyes will find the floor
And I will search my brain to find something I might get yelled at for
He'll come in with a frown and tell me, "Sit your ass right down"
Or he might get his kicks from joking that he's just playin' around
And in a few years I will leave, but I'll perpetually believe
That any man who says he loves me is hidin' somethin' up his sleeve

Wash me in the water
You can cut off all my hair
And I'll be changin' like the weather
But I'll never be like him

The other girls date older guys and wear their T-shirts late at night
But everything I own that's oversize belongs to me, it's mine
And I don't have souvenirs of all the earliest of years
You know my father isn't dead, but it don't feel like he's still here
It's strange now that he's grey and getting older by the day
And my eyes tell me that he's harmless despite what my heart has to say

So maybe just forget
Maybe move on, don't regret
Or maybe this is just another trick
That hasn't happened yet
You might also like
Wash me in the water
You can cut off all my hair
And I'll be changin' like the weather
But I'll never be like him

'Cause blood is thick but water is forever
And I'm stiffer than a board, lighter than a feather
And that girl will be a problem only if you let her
And I left her back home but I cannot forget her

I thought that it was my fault
And now sometimes I still do
You didn't chase me through the park
So now I'm chasin' after you
But I can't keep up the illusion
Or confirm your point of view
Oh, I can't bear to fake a smile when you walk into the room

'Cause blood is thick but water is forever
And I'm stiffer than a board, lighter than a feather
And that girl will be a problem only if you let her
And I left her back home but I cannot forget her
Wash me in the water
You can cut off all my hair
And I'll be changin' like the weather
But I'll never be like him

'Cause blood is thick but water is forever
And I'm stiffer than a board, lighter than a feather
And that girl will be a problem only if you let her
And I left her back home but I cannot forget her1Embed
