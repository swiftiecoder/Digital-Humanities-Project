I'm the only girl alive in L.A. County
I'm the only one who sees (Ayy)
I wake up every day in some new kind of suffering
I've never known a day of peace
I wonder if I ever left behind my body (Ooh)
Do you think they'd laugh at how I die?
Or take a photo of my family in the lobby
The ceremony's small inside
'Cause I don't know if I could sell out my own funeral (Ah-ah)
At least, not at this point in time
And if I ever try to leave behind my body (If I ever try)
Well, at least I know it was nеver mine, it was nevеr mine
It was never mine
It was never mine

Well, I'm the only girl alive in New York City
I left my wallet on the train
Since I no longer even have a driver's license
I guess that means I have no name (This is Halsey St)
And I could run away to somewhere on the West Coast
And finally be a real life girl
They'll take my organs and they'll hang me from a bedpost
Sayin' I was too soft for this world
And they'd be right, because quite frankly, to be alive
It shouldn't kill me every day, the way it does
I don't know what I did to have this fate, I'm drenched in it
And I can't even run from what I know
My special talent isn't writing, it's not singing
It's feeling everything that everyone alive feels every day
Feels every day, feels every day, feels every day
You might also like
I think I'm special 'cause I cut myself wide open
As if it's honorable to bleed
But I'm not lucky and I know I wasn’t chosen
The world keeps spinnin' without me
I told my mother I would die by twenty-seven
And in a way I sort of did
This thing I love has grown demanding and obsessive
And it wants more than I can give, than I can give, than I can give
Than I can give

Well, I'm the only girl alive in L.A. County
I've never known a day of peace
I wake up every day and wish that I was different
I look around and it's just me
It's just me, it's just me

Ah-ah, ah-ah-ah
Ooh, ayy
Wee-ooh, wee-ooh, yeah-yeah (Let's go)
Ah-ah-ah
I'm the only one, the only one, it's me3Embed
