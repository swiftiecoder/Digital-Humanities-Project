So I'm playin' the drums, right? Okay

Davey died in the summertime in a hot-boxed car
With a seatbelt 'round his neck and a needle in his arm
We would smoke out in the parkin' lot behind convenience shops
I bought a couple of grams of weed off him, but so did all the cops
Back then, the kids from all the county, we would walk out in the heat
'Long the train tracks with our paper bags, and gravel in our feet
In our heads, we picked a husband from the hundred men we knew
But I kissed a poster of a pop star and checked my breasts in casе they grew

Therе ain't a reason on this earth I'd go back to my hometown
Somewhere in the clouds, Davey's runnin' for a touchdown
The crowd appears and his mother cheers, she's wavin' from the field
And he's evergreen at seventeen for the last eleven years

Ooh-ooh, ah
Ooh-ooh, ah

You know, I never felt like anyone, I was a paradoxal lie
I didn't think that I was special, but I was too afraid to die
Like the others from my high school, all those sad suburban ghosts
Trapped in a cross next to a highway, while the rest of us get old
You might also like
There ain't a reason on this earth I'd go back to my hometown
Somewhere in the clouds, Davey's runnin' for a touchdown
The crowd appears and his mother cheers, he's wavin' from the field
And he's evergreen at seventeen for the last eleven years

Ooh-ooh, ah
Ooh-ooh, ah

The American dream means stayin' young forever
In a picture in a pamphlet, gettin' yellow from the weather
And years will pass since science class and I might forget your name
But when the crow's feet come, the kingdom come, well, you'll always look the same

There ain't a reason on this earth I'd go back to my hometown
Somewhere in the clouds, Davey's runnin' for a touchdown
The crowd appears and his mother cheers, and he's wavin' from the field
He's evergreen at seventeen for the last eleven years

Ooh-ooh, ah (Evergreen at seventeen)
Ooh-ooh, ah (Evergreen at seventeen)
Ooh-ooh-ooh (Evergreen at seventeen)
Ooh-ooh, ah (Evergreen at seventeen)Embed
