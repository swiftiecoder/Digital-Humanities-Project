I am so lucky

Everybody, get in line to meet the girl who flew too high
Who does it all just to be liked by strangers that she met online
Did it all to be included, my self-loathing so deep-rooted
Inner child's unrecruited, truth is I'm not suited for it

When I die, I won't have time to spend my money
But I hope that you still love me

'Cause I'm so lucky, I'm a star
But I cry, cry, cry in my lonely heart, thinkin'
"If there's nothin' missin' in my life
Then why (Why, why?) do these tears come at night?"

Why they come? Why they come?
Why they come? Why they come?

And why she losin' so much weight?
I heard it's from the drugs she ate
And I feel her, but I can't relate
'Cause I'd never end up in that state
A girl like that is a mother, must be tough
A problem child, I was rough
But what do you do with a difficult grownup?
You might also like
When I die, I won't have time to spend my money
But I hope that you still love me (Da-da-da-da, da-da-mm)

'Cause I'm so lucky (I'm so lucky), I'm a star
But I cry, cry, cry in my lonely heart, thinkin'
"If there's nothin' missin' in my life
Then why do these tears come at night?"

I shaved my head four times because I wanted to
And then I did it one more time 'cause I got sick (I am so lucky)
And I thought I changed so much, nobody would notice it, and no one did
Then I left the doctor's office full of tears
Became a single mom at my premiere
And I told everybody I was fine for a whole damn year
And that's the biggest lie of my career

But I'm so lucky, I'm a star
But I cry, cry, cry in my lonely heart, thinkin'
"If there's nothin' missin' in my life
Then why do these tears come at night?"
I'm so lucky, I'm a star
But I cry, cry, cry in my lonely heart, thinkin'
"If there's nothin' missin' in my life
Then why do these tears come at night?"
She's so lucky, she's so lucky
She's so lucky, she's so
Haven't you heard?6Embed
