I don't wanna go to Grandma's
So I'm quiet on the drive
I don't wanna go to Grandma's
So I'm quiet on the drive

Did he have a little brother that annoyed him all the time?
Did he wanna be a grown up?

When I was little, I was jealous, and I'd say a prayer at night
Well, I'd say

I don't wanna hurt so get it over with quick
Please, God, I wanna be loved
I don't wanna be somebody they wanna get rid ofEmbed
