20 ContributorsTranslationsItalianoEspa√±olAlice of the Upper Class Lyrics
What happened to the girl I knew?
The one so sweet, the ingenue
The jailbait, roommate, not a fuckin lightweight
Party-tail on black and blue like
I think I'm gonna miss my train
The street signs all look the same
I think I've been awake for days but it's so much fun
I have no shame

Like Alice through the looking glass
I'm tired of the upper class
I wanna go back, go back, go back, go back, go back!

I'm a freak, yeah, I'm a psycho
I feel so good when I am hypomanic
I'm mechanically up all night, though
I took another dose but I don't think it's micro
I'm a beast, yeah, I'm a monster
I knew beauty then I lost her
In a coma, can't defrost her
Can't you see that I'm an imposter?

Where's the fun in doing well?
The good girls never kiss and tell
Not the smart ass, white trash bitches in the first class
Well, that's American dreamin' in a nutshell
You gotta get me off this plane
The flight attendant said my name
The captain said, "You better buckle up
'Cause you're headed to hell in the fast lane" (Ah)
You might also like
Like Alice through the looking glass
I'm tired of the upper class
I wanna go back, go back, go back, go back, go back!

I'm a freak, yeah, I'm a psycho
I feel so good when I am hypomanic
I'm mechanically up all night, though
I took another dose but I don't think it's micro
I'm a beast, yeah, I'm a monster
I knew beauty then I lost her
In a coma, can't defrost her
Can't you see that I'm an imposter?

I know now what I always knew
I don't belong here, how 'bout you?
You can have my seat, it's yours for free
But I still get punished for good deeds
So you're watchin' from ten thousand feet
And the magazine said, "R-I-P"
And I crashed, I crashed, I crashed, I crashed, I crashed, I crashed!

I'm a freak, yeah, I'm a psycho
I feel so good when I am hypomanic
I'm mechanically up all night, though
I took another dose but I don't think it's micro
I'm a beast, yeah, I'm a monster
I knew beauty then I lost her
In a coma, can't defrost her
Can't you see that I'm an imposter?Embed
