They're cutting her up on the operating table, but it wasn't enough
The front desk pages, it's a call for the ages
They couldn't save her, they couldn't save her
The surgeon said, "She had a hole in her heart
But it wasn't her fault, it was there from the start"
Trying to love you through an open wound
'Cause everything I put inside there just fell right through
And I hold the parts together with some pressure and glue
And you're running in slow-mo to the hospital room
If you only knew
How bad it hurt me too

So now you can take the money, you can get on a plane
To a beautiful island, build a house in my name
You can donate all the money to somebody in pain
And you can rest your head down and not feel any shame
I never loved you
I never loved you
I never loved you in vain

They're sewing me shut
Opening the doors and then removing their gloves
Taking the long way to the end of the hallway
They couldn't save her, they couldn't save her
You told the nurses that we argued a lot
And you're rambling on about the last time we fought
You drove off screaming on the night you were caught
You left me standing in the parking lot
I took off chasing you down Route 22
'Cause you never listen and I'm terrible too
You kept on driving far away from the issues
If you stopped, I would've kissed you
You might also like
So now you can take the money, you can get on a plane
To a beautiful island, build a house in my name
You can donate all the money to somebody in pain
And you can rest your head down and not feel any shame
I never loved you
I never loved you
I never loved you in vain

Flash of light, heat of fire
Head on concrete and the screeching of tires
Sound of sirens, rush of pain
I almost thought I heard you call my name

So now you can take the money, you can get on a plane
To a beautiful island, build a house in my name
You can donate all the money to somebody in pain
And you can rest your head down and not feel any shame
I never loved you
I never loved you
I never loved you in vain3Embed
