Mm-mm

There's lots of fish out in the pond
In the oceans and the rivers and in all the waterfalls
But if I'm made for land and not the sea at all
Could I crawl and find some kind Neanderthal?
What if I'm from outer space?
And I have fire in my bones and in my veins?

I let it show and scare my suitors far away
Leave them traumatized with visions of its glow behind my face
They say that God makes no mistakes, but I might disagree

When I outstretch my empty hand
I watch them build society, domesticated land
It goes according to the plan
While thеy're in paradise, I'm exilеd in the sand

If everyone has someone, then the math just isn't right
And I'm the only outlier, the lonely archetype
If everything is by design, well, I might disagree
You might also like
You all know something that I don't
You all learned something that I fear I'll never know
You all grew body parts I fear I'll never grow
You all know something that I don't
You all know something that I don't
You all know something that I don't

What if I'm just cosmic dust?
Put me in a metal box that's bound to rust
Shoot me into space and leave me to combust
Return to earth and just dissolve into its crust
Well, I was born all by myself
It's not unlikely that I'll die that way as wellEmbed
