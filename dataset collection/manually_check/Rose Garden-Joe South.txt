I beg your pardon
I never promised you a rose garden
Along with the sunshine
There's gotta be a little rain some time

Now, when you take you gotta give
So live and let live
Or let go my, my, my
I beg your pardon
I never promised you a rose garden

I could promise you things like big diamond rings
But you don't find roses growin' on stalks of clover
So you better think it over

If sweet-talkin' you would make it come true
Then I'd give you the world right now on a silver platter
But what would it matter?

So smile for a while, and let's be jolly
Love shouldn't be so melancholy
Come along and share the good times while we can

I beg your pardon
I never promised you a rose garden
Along with the sunshine
There's gotta be a little rain some time

Now, when you take you gotta give
So live and let live
Or let go my, my, my
I beg your pardon
I never promised you a rose garden

I could sing you a tune and promise you the moon
But if that's what it takes to hold you, I'd just as soon let you go
But there's one thing I want you to know, oh

Look before you leap, still water runs deep
And there won't always be someone there to pull you out
And I know what I'm talkin' about

So smile for a while, and let's be jolly
Love shouldn't be so melancholy
Come along and share the good times while we can
I beg your pardon
I never promised you a rose garden
Along with the sunshine
There's gotta be a little rain some time

Now, when you take you gotta give
So live and let live
Or let go my, my, my
I beg your pardon
I never promised you a rose garden

I beg your pardon
I never promised you a rose garden
